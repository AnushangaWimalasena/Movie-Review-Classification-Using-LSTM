"excellent work by the whole cast and crew,and as always a work of perfectionist,brought up a good story and something which was buried in past ,a thing which a society doesn't accept,great work on focusing on that aspect,and a moral booster for women's,and a emotional line up for doing something for the country,showing the nation,the struggle of a father ,making that aspect possible,which the society don't even want to think about it,and Mr khan's prismatic performance as an champ wrestler,struggling father and a coach,after all Mr khan's most emotional film and as always a perfectionist as ever,to end a great step to lightened the darker side of the society",positive
"For me, enjoying a movie can be achieved by properly managing expectations; if I expect Shakespeare, and I see Shakespeare I'm happy. Now, don't get me wrong - I liked Army of Darkness, like the rest of you. If I expect to see a dumb, camp, action flick and I see a dumb, camp, action-fest, I'm happy. With the D&D movie, I expected a dumb, camp, action flick, and I received something that was so unexpectedly foul that it caused me to write the world about it. How did this movie even get made? Now, I play D&D ( admit it, y'all do too ) so don't fault me for 'not understanding the genre'. The movie had too many characters, some of which disappear inexplicably during the course of the movie. The plot made no sense; the twists at the end came from nowhere. And don't get me started on Marlon Wayans's character - you mean to tell me that in the fantasy world of D&D, a black man can't get a role other than the Black Buddy Cop stereotype?",negative
"The only thing I can write as an average Joe who watches movies simply to be entertained or see a story being told, is that I watched 12 Men argue in a room for more than an hour and I couldn't look away from the screen. Simply a masterpiece!",positive
"Second-hand embarrassment at its finest. Even a person who never tried to write a script or tried to hold a camera in their life could maintain a quality like this. Just so you know, you could at least put some effort in it. I don't know, make it somehow interesting or put some experienced actors, this movie is something a high-schooler would make. I'm not sure if this movie really took time, with this poor quality. Oh and, the creator himself is actually trying to make this movie look good by calling out his fans. Smh.",negative
"This movie is one of the greatest of all time. It is adapted from a book by Chuck Palahniuk. This movie has very interesting themes like emasculation, violence, chaos, societal breakdown, isolation, the threat of death and consumerism. The direction is sublime. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly. Also they did a good job with the inter-cuts. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were the perfect choice to lead this movie. When you are watching the movie you just are glued to your seat, that is just how good it is",positive
